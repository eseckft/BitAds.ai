"""
This module defines SQLAlchemy ORM entities for managing visitor and user agent activities in the miner subsystem.

Classes:
    Visitor: Represents a visitor entity with attributes such as ID, referer, IP address, country, user agent,
             campaign details, miner hotkey, activity metrics, device information, uniqueness status,
             return in site status, visit status, and creation timestamp.
    VisitorActivity: Represents visitor activity entity with attributes including IP address, activity date,
                     and activity count.
    UserAgent: Represents user agent activity entity with attributes including user agent string, activity date,
               and activity count.

Notes:
    - These entities are mapped to corresponding database tables in the miner subsystem.
    - Visitor entity tracks detailed visitor information including campaign details and visit metrics.
    - VisitorActivity entity tracks activity counts based on IP address and date.
    - UserAgent entity tracks activity counts based on user agent string and date.
